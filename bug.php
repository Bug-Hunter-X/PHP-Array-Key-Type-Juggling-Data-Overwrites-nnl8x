In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly integers or strings.  If you use an object as an array key, PHP will perform a type juggling operation, converting it into a string representation. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when comparing keys or using them in loops.  Consider this example:

```php
$obj1 = new stdClass();
$obj2 = new stdClass();

$array = [];
$array[$obj1] = 'value1';
$array[$obj2] = 'value2';

// You might expect this to print 'value1', but it won't!
var_dump($array[(object)[]]); // This will print 'value2'
```

This happens because both `$obj1` and `$obj2` are converted to strings representing their objects, which are likely to be the same, causing the second value to overwrite the first.  This can lead to difficult-to-debug data loss or unexpected behavior.  Similar issues can occur with other complex data types used as keys.
