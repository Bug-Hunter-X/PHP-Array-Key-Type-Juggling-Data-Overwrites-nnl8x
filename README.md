# PHP Array Key Type Juggling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially serious bug in PHP related to array key type juggling.  When non-string or non-integer values are used as array keys, PHP implicitly converts them to strings.  This can result in unexpected data overwrites and difficult-to-debug issues.

The `bug.php` file contains code illustrating the problem.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution demonstrating how to handle array keys effectively to avoid this error.

This bug is especially relevant for developers working with objects as array keys or when dealing with complex data structures that may involve type conversions.  The solution emphasizes the importance of using strict string or integer keys to ensure predictable array behavior.
